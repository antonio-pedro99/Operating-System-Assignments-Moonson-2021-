# CSE231 : Operating Systems (Moonson)


This repository contains all my codes for CSE231's assignments. I have made this repo private while the course was going on, and public after all deadlines.

# This Repo contains:
    This Readme and all git files.
    All assignments in subdirectories.

# Each Subdirectory contains:
    A folder denoting the question number and a Readme file too.

## How to compile
    run make
